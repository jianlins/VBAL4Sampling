# VBAL4Sampling
Enhancing Active Learning for Annotation Sampling over Large-Scale Corpus Via Vector-Based Indexing. A Placeholder Repository for AMIA 2024 Submission. The code will be released upon acceptance.

inside the notebooks folder:
[gpu01_CleanupBratAnnotation.ipynb](notebooks%2Fgpu01_CleanupBratAnnotation.ipynb) is used to clean the original annotations and build vector indexes.
[dev19_stats_sentence_sampling.ipynb](notebooks%2Fdev19_stats_sentence_sampling.ipynb) is the stats comparison among different approaches' outputs, which were pickled in the data folder.
The other notebooks are different approaches to apply the bootstrap method to generate outputs.

[dev19_stats_sentence_sampling.html](notebooks%2Farchive%2Fdev19_stats_sentence_sampling.html) is the exported html format of  [dev19_stats_sentence_sampling.ipynb](notebooks%2Fdev19_stats_sentence_sampling.ipynb)
