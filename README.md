inside the notebooks folder:
* [gpu01_CleanupBratAnnotation.ipynb](notebooks%2Fgpu01_CleanupBratAnnotation.ipynb) is used to clean the original annotations and build vector indexes.
* [dev19_stats_sentence_sampling.ipynb](notebooks%2Fdev19_stats_sentence_sampling.ipynb) is the stats comparison among different approaches' outputs, which were pickled in the data folder.
* The other notebooks are different approaches to apply the bootstrap method to generate outputs.
* [dev19_stats_sentence_sampling.html](notebooks%2Farchive%2Fdev19_stats_sentence_sampling.html) is the exported html format of  [dev19_stats_sentence_sampling.ipynb](notebooks%2Fdev19_stats_sentence_sampling.ipynb)
